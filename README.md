# appDevAssignment
This Agro Count application performs calculations such as monthly costs and profits based on data retrieved from database. This assignment taught me about polymorphism and inheritence in greater detail and how to use Visual Studio and C#. 
This is the first assignment that really tested my adaptability. During the completion of this assignment I recall finding myself stuck for days on what I now know were simple problems but seemed unsolvable at the time.Thank goodness I learned how to use Visual Studio Code's debugger.
